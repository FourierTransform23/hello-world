# hello-world

Hello world,
A bit about me:

I like green eggs & ham, books about Abraham Lincoln, and moments when I can "Trust the Process". I prefer listening Jazz, Country & Hip Hop. When I'm away from the Linux machine, you can find me by the futbol pitch or in the kitchen. I wake up early to work out so I can "Strive for Greatness". Lastly, I love learning more about derivatives in the financial markets.
